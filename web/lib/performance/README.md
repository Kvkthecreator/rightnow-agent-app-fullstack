# Performance System

## Status: Experimental / Not Yet Integrated

The performance monitoring and optimization system is in development but not yet integrated into the main application.

### Available Files
- `CacheManager.ts` - Advanced caching system (not yet used)
- `ProductionOptimizer.ts` - Bundle optimization tooling
- `PerfProfiler.ts` - Performance profiling tools

### Integration Status
- ❌ CacheManager not integrated with API client
- ❌ Performance metrics not collected in production
- ❌ Bundle optimization not configured
- ✅ Basic performance monitoring via browser APIs exists elsewhere

### Future Work
When performance becomes a bottleneck:
1. Integrate CacheManager with ApiClient for request caching
2. Add performance metrics collection
3. Enable production bundle optimization
4. Set up performance monitoring dashboard

For now, the application runs fast enough without these optimizations.
