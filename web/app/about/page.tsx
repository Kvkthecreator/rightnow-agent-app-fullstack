            In the age of AI, our greatest challenge isn't generating ideas—it's maintaining clarity. LLM chats quickly become a sea of repetition and contradiction. You're forced to become a context janitor, constantly reminding the AI of what you've already decided.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-2xl">
            yarnnn ends that cycle. It’s an opinionated memory system built on a simple principle: <strong>your context should be defended.</strong> By allowing you to <strong>Lock In</strong> core decisions as canonical truth, Yarnnn gives you the power to evolve your ideas with confidence and integrity.
