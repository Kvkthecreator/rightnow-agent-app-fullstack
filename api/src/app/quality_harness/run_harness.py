iPhone revenue grew to $43.8 billion despite market headwinds. Services revenue hit an all-time high of $22.3 billion.
CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is seeing strong demand for iPhone 15 Pro models. The company's installed base 
reached an all-time high across all product categories. Apple's board declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share.
Looking ahead, CFO Luca Maestri guided for continued growth but warned of foreign exchange headwinds. The company 
expects services growth to decelerate slightly in the next quarter. Apple continues to invest heavily in AI and 
machine learning capabilities across its product line. The Mac segment saw particular strength with the M3 chip launch.
Wearables revenue declined slightly due to difficult comparisons with the previous year's Apple Watch Ultra launch.""",

Log analysis showed the attackers exploited a known vulnerability in an outdated third-party library. No customer data

We have implemented additional monitoring and upgraded all third-party dependencies. A full security audit is recommended.
