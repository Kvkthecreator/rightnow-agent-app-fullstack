Services revenue: $23.1B (+11.3% YoY)
Gross margin: 45.9% (vs 43.0% Q4 2022)

CEO Commentary: "We're pleased with our performance despite challenging conditions. 
iPhone 15 Pro demand exceeded expectations, particularly in China where we saw 
strong adoption. Our services business continues to drive growth with record 
App Store revenue. Looking ahead, we're optimistic about our AI initiatives."

CFO Notes: "Operating expenses increased 4.2% primarily due to R&D investments 
in generative AI and machine learning. We maintained strong cash generation 
with $29.5B in operating cash flow. Board approved 15% dividend increase."

Analyst Concerns: "Margins may face pressure from competitive dynamics in China.
Services growth could decelerate as App Store faces regulatory scrutiny."
