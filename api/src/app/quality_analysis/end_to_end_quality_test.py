On September 15, 2024, at 3:42 AM UTC, our SOC detected unusual network activity from IP addresses in Eastern Europe. The attackers exploited CVE-2024-8901 in our legacy authentication service, which enabled initial access to the internal network.

Following the breach, lateral movement was detected across multiple systems due to excessive service account permissions. The attackers attempted to access our customer database containing 2.3M records.

However, our DLP system activated automatically when data exfiltration was attempted. This prevented any customer data from leaving the network. The incident was contained within 47 minutes.

Recovery costs totaled $120K, but we avoided potential $5M in data breach penalties. If the DLP system had failed, the impact would have been catastrophic for our business.""",

The September incident revealed critical gaps in our security architecture. The legacy authentication service (version 2.1) had not been updated in 18 months, making it vulnerable to known exploits.

Our Zero Trust implementation was incomplete. Service accounts had broad permissions across multiple environments, which amplified the attack scope. This design flaw enabled lateral movement that should have been impossible.

Positive findings: The DLP system performed exactly as designed. Automated response protocols activated within 3 minutes of detection. The incident response team's 47-minute containment exceeded our 60-minute SLA.

Recommendations: 1) Accelerate Zero Trust migration, 2) Implement least-privilege access, 3) Upgrade legacy systems quarterly rather than annually.""",
