TEST_FINANCIAL_CONTENT = """Apple reported record Q4 2023 earnings with revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year. 
iPhone revenue grew to $69.7 billion despite market headwinds. Services revenue hit an all-time high of $23.1 billion, growing 11.3% YoY.
CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is seeing strong demand for iPhone 15 Pro models, particularly in China. 
The company's installed base reached an all-time high across all product categories. Apple's board declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share.
Looking ahead, CFO Luca Maestri guided for continued growth but warned of foreign exchange headwinds. The company 
expects services growth to decelerate slightly in the next quarter. Apple continues to invest heavily in AI and 
machine learning capabilities across its product line. The Mac segment saw particular strength with the M3 chip launch.
Wearables revenue declined slightly due to difficult comparisons with the previous year's Apple Watch Ultra launch."""

TEST_SECURITY_CONTENT = """On January 15, 2024, at 3:47 AM UTC, our monitoring systems detected unusual network activity on servers 
in the EU-WEST region. Initial investigation revealed unauthorized access attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe.
The security team immediately initiated incident response protocols. All affected systems were isolated within 12 minutes.
Log analysis showed the attackers exploited a known vulnerability in an outdated third-party library (CVE-2023-4567). 
No customer data was accessed or exfiltrated based on our forensic analysis. The vulnerability was patched across all systems by 5:15 AM.
We have implemented additional monitoring and upgraded all third-party dependencies. A full security audit is recommended.
All customers in the affected region should be notified as a precautionary measure. Two-factor authentication should be 
mandatory for all administrative accounts going forward. The attack was stopped by our DLP system before any data left the network."""
