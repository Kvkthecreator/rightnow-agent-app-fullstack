# YARNNN Integration Workspace ‚Äì Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs in place

### 1. Shared Integration Core (`packages/core`)
- Tool schemas and handlers for create/get/add/validate substrate flows
- Auth utilities (`validateAuth`, `extractToken`) with pluggable backend URL
- Typed HTTP client (`YARNNNClient`) that injects workspace/basket headers
- Type definitions for all YARNNN MCP payloads
- Published via workspace package `@yarnnn/integration-core`

### 2. Anthropic Adapter (`adapters/anthropic`)
- Production-ready MCP server (stdio + HTTP/SSE)
- Routes `ListTools` / `CallTool` requests through the shared core
- Environment-driven configuration (transport, backend URL, logging)
- Health endpoint and graceful shutdown logic for cloud deployment
- NPM binaries (`yarnnn-mcp-anthropic`) for easy CLI invocation

### 3. OpenAI Adapter Scaffold (`adapters/openai-apps`)
- Express-based HTTP stub with `/health` and `/tools` routes
- Shares core tool catalogue but returns 501 for execution (placeholder)
- Config surface ready for OAuth credentials (`OPENAI_CLIENT_ID`, etc.)
- Future work: wire into OpenAI Apps SDK, implement OAuth handlers, render structured responses

### 4. Workspace Tooling
- npm workspaces manage installs/builds for core + adapters
- Shared `tsconfig.base.json` and per-package build/typecheck scripts
- Updated README/compatibility docs describing the new layering

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Implementation Steps

1. **OpenAI Apps SDK Integration**
   - Implement OAuth handshake and session storage in `adapters/openai-apps`
   - Register tools via Apps SDK, returning structured components for ChatGPT UI
   - Harden security (state parameter, token rotation) and add e2e tests

2. **Shared Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core tool handlers (mock backend responses)
   - Add adapter-specific smoke tests (stdio/HTTP for Anthropic, HTTP for OpenAI)
   - Wire tests into CI pipelines

3. **Deployment**
   - Provision separate Render services for Anthropic and OpenAI adapters
   - Configure required environment variables per service (see `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
   - Monitor via `/health` endpoints and add logging/alerting as needed

4. **Future Platforms**
   - Use the same pattern (new adapter consuming `@yarnnn/integration-core`)
   - Keep backend contracts protocol-agnostic to support additional hosts without backend changes

## Smoke Test Commands

```bash
# Core typecheck
npm run typecheck -w @yarnnn/integration-core

# Anthropic adapter (stdio)
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:10000 npm run dev:anthropic

# Anthropic adapter (http)
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:10000 MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=3000 npm run start -w @yarnnn/anthropic-mcp

# OpenAI scaffold
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:10000 PORT=4000 npm run dev:openai
```

## Key Benefits of the Refactor
- **Single source of truth** for tool behaviour and backend wiring
- **Decoupled adapters** that evolve independently per platform requirements
- **Future-proof**: when OpenAI offers native MCP, swap the adapter without touching core logic
- **Clear deployment story**: one Render service per platform, sharing the same backend
