## Sample Codex Prompt: (Copy-paste this every time)

Use my design system exactly as follows:
Color classes like bg-background, bg-primary, bg-card, etc. refer to Tailwind utilities that map to CSS variables from the shadcn/ui official theme, set in :root and .dark.
No Tailwind default palette classes (e.g., bg-white, bg-slate-900)â€”replace with variable-based classes.
Use rounded-lg or rounded-2xl per my guide for border radius.
For cards: bg-card rounded-2xl shadow-sm p-6
For buttons: bg-primary text-primary-foreground rounded-lg px-4 py-2
Font: Inter (from Tailwind), headings as text-xl font-semibold
Use only spacing, radii, and shadows as specified in my theme guide (below).
