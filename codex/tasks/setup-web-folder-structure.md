# ðŸ§  Codex Task: Setup Web Folder Structure
The `/web` folder is already structured with subfolders for `components/`, `layouts/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `constants/`, and `styles/`.

Your task is to scaffold the foundational files inside these folders for a scalable Next.js application.

Start with:
- `/layouts/default.tsx`: Create a default layout shell using `<Header />`, `<main>`, and `<Footer />`.
- `/components/Header.tsx` and `/components/Footer.tsx`: Create minimal placeholder components.
- `/lib/utils.ts`: Add a basic helper function (e.g., `capitalize`).
- Optionally, create `/types/index.ts` with placeholder types.

Keep all files minimal but syntactically valid. Do not generate boilerplate from scratch â€” focus on clean, production-suitable structure.

Log all created files and decisions in:  
`codex/sessions/setup-web-folder-structure-session.md`
