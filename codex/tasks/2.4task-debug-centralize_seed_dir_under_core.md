Task â€” Centralize seed directory under core

Overview

Right now your task_types.json lives under core/task_registry/seed/. To follow Option B, we want a single core/seed/ folder for all future seed data. We need to:

Move api/src/core/task_registry/seed to api/src/core/seed

Remove the empty seed folder under task_registry

Ensure the FileProvider continues to find the file via the existing SEED_PATH (which is already parents[2]/seed/task_types.json).

This reshuffle should be safe at runtime because the code uses a relative path (two levels up to core). Once moved, the existing path logic still resolves correctly.

Steps

Move the folder:

mv api/src/core/task_registry/seed api/src/core/seed

Delete the now-empty folder:

rmdir api/src/core/task_registry/seed

Verify no other references hard-code the old path. The only usage is in providers/file.py:

- SEED_PATH = Path(__file__).parents[2] / "seed" / "task_types.json"
+ SEED_PATH = Path(__file__).parents[2] / "seed" / "task_types.json"

(No change needed because this already matches.)

Restart the FastAPI server and test:

cd api/src
uvicorn app.agent_server:app --reload
curl http://localhost:8000/task-types

You should receive your seeded JSON back.
