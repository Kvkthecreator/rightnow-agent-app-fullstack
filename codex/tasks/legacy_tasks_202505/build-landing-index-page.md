# ðŸ§  Codex Task: Build Index (Landing) Page

## ðŸ“„ Task Title
Build initial `/` (index) landing page for the app using Tailwind CSS and modular layout structure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Create a simple, professional landing page that will serve as the entry point for users.
The layout should:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Be structured to support future reusable components
- Fit within existing `/web` Next.js app

## ðŸ§  Prompt to Codex
```
Build a modern, clean landing page using Tailwind CSS and Next.js.
Include:
- A centered hero section with headline, subtext, and a CTA button
- An optional logo at the top
- A feature grid with 3 points
- Responsive mobile styling
Wrap the layout with placeholder `Header` and `Footer` tags, but donâ€™t implement those components yet.
Use semantic HTML structure and Tailwind utility classes.
``` 

## ðŸ—‚ Context
- File: `web/app/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router entrypoint)
- Tailwind already installed (check `globals.css`)
- `shadcn/ui` is being considered but **not required** for this task
