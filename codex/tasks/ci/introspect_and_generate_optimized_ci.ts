# - python version from pyproject.toml
# - use of poetry
# - presence of ruff for linting
# - pytest or make test usage
# - whether env vars are required for tests

# ðŸš€ After introspection, Codex will scaffold:
# - Setup Python
# - Install poetry
# - Cache dependencies
# - Run tests using correct commands
# - Optionally run lint step if present
# - Trigger only when relevant files change (api/**, tests/**, .github/workflows/**)

# Codex: Begin with environment scan before writing CI config.
