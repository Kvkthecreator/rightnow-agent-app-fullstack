## 🧠 Codex Session Log: init-theme-config

### ✅ Task Summary

Codex was asked to initialize the baseline theme configuration for our frontend, using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. The task included setting tokens for:

* Border radius
* Font family
* Container behavior
* Color palette references
* Shadows and spacing

A theme reference guide (`/styles/theme-guide.md`) was also requested.

### ⚙️ What Happened

* Codex correctly parsed the full markdown task.
* It did not apply the actual file changes.
* No `tailwind.config.js` or `theme-guide.md` was created by Codex itself.

### 🧪 Manual Actions Taken

* Verified that `tailwind.config.js` did not exist
* Manually created and placed `tailwind.config.js` inside `/web` folder
* Pasted correct configuration based on task prompt
* Verified file presence with `ls -l tailwind.config.js`

### 📍 Environment Observations

* Codex read the task fine but likely ran in a read-only or dry-run mode
* CLI may have lacked `--apply` or write flag
* Path ambiguity in monorepo may have prevented correct file targeting

### ✅ Resolution Status

* `tailwind.config.js` manually created and populated ✅
* Theme tokens now live and in-use ✅

### 🔁 Next Steps / Takeaways

* Use `--apply` or verify write behavior in Codex when expecting file changes
* Confirm relative paths when working in a monorepo (e.g. run from `/web`)
* Add a micro-task later to confirm write access

Next task: Create reusable `TextInputField` component using `react-hook-form` + `shadcn/ui`, styled per `theme-guide.md`.
