# Session Log: Refactor Homepage Hero + Layout

## Decisions & Implementation Notes
- Removed `useState` hook and interactivity around the old “how it works” toggle; replaced with anchor-based navigation (`#value-stats`).
- Overhauled Hero section:
  - Applied `py-24` and `space-y-6` for vertical rhythm.
  - Adjusted headline to `text-5xl sm:text-6xl font-bold text-center leading-tight`.
  - Updated subheadline with `text-lg text-center text-gray-500 mt-4` and added tail callout text.
  - Laid out CTA buttons in a responsive stack (`flex-col sm:flex-row`) with variants `outline` and `default`.
- Implemented Mid-Section (Value + Stats):
  - Wrapped in a two-column grid (`md:grid-cols-2`) with top/bottom borders and proper padding.
  - Left column contains descriptive text styled `text-2xl font-medium leading-relaxed`.
  - Right column uses a 3-column grid on `sm` with bordered stat cards (`border p-6 rounded-lg`) and typographic hierarchy (`text-5xl font-bold` for numbers, `text-sm text-muted-foreground` for labels).
- Redesigned Footer:
  - Converted to a 3-column grid (`md:grid-cols-3`) under a top border.
  - Column 1: Company logo via `<Logo variant="dark" />`.
  - Column 2: CONTACT block with email address.
  - Column 3: Privacy Policy & Services links using `next/link`.
- Ensured mobile responsiveness by leveraging Tailwind’s `sm` and `md` breakpoints, and consistent horizontal paddings (`px-4 sm:px-6`).
