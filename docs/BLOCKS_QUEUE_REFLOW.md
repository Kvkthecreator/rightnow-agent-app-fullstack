# Block and Queue Scope Management

## context_blocks.meta_scope

This field defines how and where the block was created:
- `basket`: Created during task/basket creation
- `profile`: Created during onboarding
- `agent`: Auto-generated by LLM
- `global`: System-supplied or team-wide block

## Rules:
- `basket`-scoped blocks cannot be auto-updated without manual approval
- `agent`-scoped blocks may be evolved by orchestration
- Queue entries now include `source_scope` to clarify origin of the proposed update

## Worker Behavior:
- `apply_queue_worker` skips blocks with `meta_scope = 'basket'` unless explicitly marked
- Rejected or conflicting updates are logged
