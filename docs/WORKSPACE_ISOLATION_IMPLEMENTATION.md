# Workspace Isolation Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Phase 1 Day 3-4: Workspace Isolation Hardening** addressing 5 canon compliance failures:

1. ✅ **RLS Policy Audit & Implementation** - All workspace-scoped tables now have proper RLS
2. ✅ **Single Workspace Resolution** - Canonical workspace resolver enforces single workspace per user  
3. ✅ **Workspace Boundary Guards** - Search/filtering operations respect workspace boundaries
4. ✅ **Timeline Event Workspace Scoping** - All events properly workspace-isolated

## Components Implemented

### 1. **RLS Migration** (`20250828_fix_workspace_isolation_rls.sql`)
- ✅ Added RLS to `blocks`, `context_items`, `documents`, `raw_dumps`, `narrative` tables
- ✅ Fixed `events` table from user-scoped to workspace-scoped policies
- ✅ Service role maintains full access for backend operations
- ✅ All policies enforce workspace membership validation

### 2. **Canonical Workspace Resolver** (`/lib/canon/WorkspaceResolver.ts`)
- ✅ Enforces "Single workspace per user" canon principle
- ✅ Detects and logs multiple workspace violations
- ✅ Provides canonical workspace resolution for all API routes
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing `ensureWorkspaceForUser`

### 3. **Workspace Boundary Guard** (`/lib/canon/WorkspaceBoundaryGuard.ts`)
- ✅ Validates workspace access for all operations
- ✅ Prevents cross-workspace data leakage in queries
- ✅ Provides workspace-scoped filtering and pagination
- ✅ Validates search parameters for workspace violations

### 4. **Timeline Event Workspace Scoping** (Updated `TimelineEventEmitter.ts`)
- ✅ All timeline events require `workspace_id` parameter
- ✅ Events properly isolated by workspace via RLS
- ✅ Canon-compliant event emission with workspace context

## Database Changes Applied

### Tables Now Protected by RLS:
```sql
-- Previously missing RLS, now protected:
ALTER TABLE blocks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE context_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE raw_dumps ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE narrative ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Fixed workspace scoping:
-- events table now workspace-scoped instead of user-scoped
```

### Policy Pattern Applied:
Each workspace-scoped table now has 5 policies:
- `{table}_select_workspace_member` - Read access via workspace membership
- `{table}_insert_workspace_member` - Insert access via workspace membership  
- `{table}_update_workspace_member` - Update access via workspace membership
- `{table}_delete_workspace_member` - Delete access via workspace membership
- `{table}_service_role_all` - Full backend access for service operations

## Canon Compliance Improvements

### Before Implementation:
- ❌ **blocks** - No RLS at all
- ❌ **context_items** - No RLS at all
- ❌ **documents** - No RLS at all  
- ❌ **events** - User-scoped instead of workspace-scoped
- ❌ **narrative** - No RLS at all
- ❌ **raw_dumps** - Only service_role policies
- ❌ **Multiple workspaces** allowed per user
- ❌ **Cross-workspace queries** possible

### After Implementation:
- ✅ **All tables** have proper workspace isolation RLS
- ✅ **Single workspace** enforced per user (canonical resolution)
- ✅ **Cross-workspace access** prevented at multiple layers
- ✅ **Timeline events** properly workspace-scoped
- ✅ **Search/filtering** respects workspace boundaries
- ✅ **Service role** maintains backend operational access

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Defense in Depth**
- RLS policies at database level (primary defense)
- Workspace boundary guards at application level  
- Canonical workspace resolver prevents multiple workspaces
- Timeline events require explicit workspace context

### 2. **Canon Compliance**
- Enforces "Single workspace per user (strong guarantee)"
- Prevents cross-workspace data leakage
- Maintains workspace isolation across all substrate types
- Timeline events properly scoped to workspace

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing API routes continue working
- `ensureWorkspaceForUser` updated to use canonical resolver
- Service role access preserved for backend operations
- No breaking changes to client code

## Testing the Implementation

### Validation Queries:
```sql
-- Check RLS enabled on all workspace tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('baskets', 'blocks', 'context_items', 'documents', 'raw_dumps', 'events', 'narrative');

-- Check workspace isolation policies exist  
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE policyname LIKE '%workspace_member%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Expected Test Results:
- Canon compliance tests should now pass for workspace isolation
- Cross-workspace data access attempts should be blocked
- Single workspace resolution should be enforced
- Timeline events should be workspace-scoped

## Next Steps

With workspace isolation hardened, the next phase is:
1. **Timeline System Overhaul** (Day 5) - Ensure append-only, canonical format
2. **Substrate Type Parity** (Week 2) - All substrate types treated as peers
3. **Document Composition Fixes** (Week 2) - Equal weighting in composition

The workspace isolation foundation is now solid and canon-compliant.
