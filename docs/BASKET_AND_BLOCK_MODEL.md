# Yarnnn Canonical Model â€” Basket, Block, and Their Interactions

**Versionâ€¯1.0 â€” aligned with Basketâ€“Blockâ€“Lockâ€“Constant Contract v1**

This file defines *business semantics* (names, statuses, relationships). DB DDL lives in the contract.

## ðŸŸ£ Block

| Field             | Purpose                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id` (uuid)       | PK                                                                     |
| `basket_id`       | FK                                                                     |
| `parent_block_id` | Enables hierarchy                                                      |
| `semantic_type`   | e.g. `task`, `brand_name`, `tone`, `identity`                          |
| `content`         | Markdown / JSON                                                        |
| `version`         | Int autoâ€‘increment                                                     |
| `state`           | `PROPOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, `LOCKED`, `CONSTANT`, `SUPERSEDED`, `REJECTED` |
| `scope`           | null / `WORKSPACE` / `ORG` / `GLOBAL` (only for Constants)             |
| `canonical_value` | Authoritative string/JSON (Locks & Constants)                          |
| `origin_ref`      | raw\_dump, file, or block UUID                                         |
| `meta_tags`       | text\[]                                                                |

### State meanings

* **PROPOSED** â€“ awaiting approval
* **ACCEPTED (â– )** â€“ part of basket meaning
* **LOCKED (ðŸ”’)** â€“ frozen in this basket
* **CONSTANT (â˜…)** â€“ workspace/org/global authority
* **SUPERSEDED** â€“ replaced by newer Constant/Lock
* **REJECTED (âœ•)** â€“ discarded proposal

## ðŸŸ£ Relationships & flow

```
Basket (ACTIVE)
  â”œâ”€ Block PROPOSED   â†’ user approves â†’ â–  ACCEPTED
  â”œâ”€ Block ACCEPTED   â†’ owner locks   â†’ ðŸ”’ LOCKED
  â””â”€ Block LOCKED     â†’ promote       â†’ â˜… CONSTANT (scope=WORKSPACE)
```

* Basket **state** advances automatically when all narrative blocks reach ACCEPTED/LOCKED.
* Revisions capture every transition; Events feed validators & UIs.

---

## ðŸŸ£ Design rules

1. Basket is the *whole*, Blocks are *parts*; history + RawDump make the whole > Î£parts.
2. Locks protect meaning *locally*; Constants protect meaning *across baskets* within `scope`.
3. Narrative view assembles **ACCEPTED** + **LOCKED** content blocks in `order` (if set).
4. Agents never mutate RawDump; they propose Blocks.

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

This model is authoritative for naming, statuses, and relationships. Schema migrations or API designs that diverge require an update here **and** in the contract.
