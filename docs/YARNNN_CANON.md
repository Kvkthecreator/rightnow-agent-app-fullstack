# YARNNN Canon v3.1 — The Authoritative Reference

**⚠️ STATUS (2025-10-31)**: This document describes YARNNN v3.1 architecture. For current v4.0 documentation, see [docs/canon/YARNNN_PLATFORM_CANON_V4.md](canon/YARNNN_PLATFORM_CANON_V4.md)

**The Single Source of Truth for Yarnnn Service Philosophy and Implementation**

**🚨 MAJOR UPDATE (2025-01-15)**: Architecture upgraded to v3.1 - Semantic Layer Integration
- **v3.0**: Substrate unified (context_items → blocks), emergent anchors, universal versioning
- **v3.1**: Semantic intelligence layer (vector embeddings + causal relationships)
- **See**: [YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md](./YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md) for substrate reference
- **See**: [archive/planning/SEMANTIC_LAYER_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md](archive/planning/SEMANTIC_LAYER_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md) for historical semantic architecture (archived)

## 🌊 Core Philosophy: Memory-First, Substrate-Equal

Yarnnn is a **memory-first cognitive system** that captures human thought as immutable substrate, allows it to evolve through agent interpretation, and presents it back through deliberate narrative composition.

### The Five Sacred Principles

1. **Capture is Sacred** - All user input becomes an immutable `raw_dump`
2. **All Substrates are Peers** - No substrate type is privileged over another
3. **Narrative is Deliberate** - Documents are composed views of substrate, not editable artifacts
4. **Agent Intelligence is Mandatory** - Substrate cannot exist without agent interpretation
5. **Substrate Management Replaces Document Editing** - Users curate substrate and direct composition instead of editing prose

### The Three Governance Principles (v2.2)

1. **Substrate-Only Governance** - ALL substrate mutations flow through governance framework
2. **User-Controlled Execution Mode** - Users control execution policy via governance flags  
3. **Confidence-Informed Routing** - Confidence scores inform routing within governance modes

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Governance Scope Boundaries

**GOVERNED (Substrate Layer - Memory):**
- `raw_dumps` creation (P0 - direct only, no proposals)
- `blocks` mutations (P1 - via proposals, all semantic_types)
- `timeline_events` (system controlled)

**INDEPENDENT (Artifact Layer - Expression):**
- **P3 Insights** - Direct regeneration from substrate state (insight_canon, doc_insight, timeboxed_insight)
- **P4 Documents** - Direct composition from P3 + substrate (document_canon, starter_prompt)
- `substrate_references` - Document-substrate metadata linking
- All artifact analytics and composition stats
- **Review insights** - Computed ephemeral (cached in proposals table for audit)

**P3/P4 Governance Boundary**:
- Regeneration is **DIRECT** (not governed proposals) - artifacts derived from substrate, don't mutate it
- Policy controls: Auto-regeneration flags, workspace synthesis permissions, throttling
- Freshness computed from context (substrate_hash, graph_signature), not time thresholds

**Canon v3.0 Revolution**: Documents are no longer editable. They are composed views of substrate state that regenerate when substrate changes or composition instructions are refined. Users manage substrate, not prose.

## 🎯 Conceptual Model

```
User Thought → Raw Capture → Agent Processing → Substrate Evolution → Reflection Derivation → Narrative Composition
     ↓             ↓              ↓                    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
  Memory       Immutable      Intelligence        Structured            Read-Model           Deliberate
  Stream        Dumps          Required           Substrates            Patterns             Documents
```

## 📚 Substrate vs Artifact Distinction

### Three Substrate Types (Memory Layer) — v3.0

1. **raw_dumps** - Immutable user input (text, files, captures) - Sacred capture
2. **blocks** - ALL structured substrate (knowledge, meaning, structural) - Unified memory
   - `semantic_type` differentiates: `fact`, `intent`, `entity`, `metric`, etc.
   - Emergent `anchor_role` for strategic categorization
   - Universal versioning via `parent_block_id` chains
   - Scope elevation for cross-basket memory (`WORKSPACE`, `ORG`, `GLOBAL`)
3. **timeline_events** - Append-only activity stream - System memory

**Critical v3.0 change**: `context_items` merged into `blocks` table for unified substrate architecture.

**See**: [YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md](./YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md) for complete details on:
- Semantic types (knowledge vs meaning vs structural)
- Emergent anchor system (no predefined roles)
- Universal versioning (all blocks version identically)
- Scope levels (basket → workspace → org → global memory)

### Two Artifact Types (Expression Layer)

**P3: Insights** - Immutable interpretations of substrate (understanding what matters)
- `insight_canon` - Basket-level "what matters now" (one current per basket)
- `doc_insight` - Document-scoped interpretations (one per document)
- `timeboxed_insight` - Temporal window understanding (many per basket)
- `review_insight` - Proposal evaluation intelligence (ephemeral, computed)
- Cross-basket insights - Workspace-level synthesis (one current per workspace)

**P4: Documents** - Immutable governed views of substrate (activation surfaces)
- `document_canon` - Basket Context Canon (mandatory: one per basket)
- `starter_prompt` - Reasoning capsules for external hosts (many per basket)
- `artifact_other` - Future document types (extensible)

**Critical**: Artifacts are derived FROM substrates, never the reverse. No artifact recursion.

**P3/P4 Revolution**:
- **Insights (P3)** = Interpretive intelligence layer - "what matters now"
- **Documents (P4)** = Composition definitions generating versioned snapshots
- **Immutability**: Content never edited in place - evolution via regeneration only
- **Lineage**: Every artifact tracks previous versions via `previous_id`
- **Provenance**: Every artifact records `derived_from` (blocks, reflections, proposals)
- **Context-Driven Freshness**: Staleness computed from substrate_hash + graph_signature changes, not time

## 🔄 The Four Pipelines (Substrate → Artifacts)

| Pipeline | Layer | Purpose | Sacred Rule | V3.1 Semantic Layer |
|----------|-------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **P0: Capture** | Substrate | Ingest raw memory | Only writes raw_dumps, never interprets (always direct, no proposals) | **NO CHANGE** - Raw dumps not embedded |
| **P1: Governed Evolution** | Substrate | Intelligent substrate evolution with duplicate detection | **All Create/Revise/Merge via governance proposals** | **UPGRADED** - Uses semantic search for duplicate/merge detection |
| **P3: Insights** | Artifact | Generate interpretive intelligence | Creates P3 insights, never modifies substrate | **ENHANCED** - Semantic retrieval for deeper insights |
| **P4: Documents** | Artifact | Theme-based narrative composition | Creates P4 documents, consumes substrate + P3 insights | **ENHANCED** - Semantic theme search for narrative coherence |

**Note:** P2 Graph Intelligence has been **permanently removed** (Canon v3.1). It was replaced by **Neural Map** - a zero-cost client-side visualization that clusters substrate by semantic type into brain regions. See rationale below.

### Why P2 Relationships Were Removed (Canon v3.1)

**Decision:** P2 Graph Agent and `substrate_relationships` table removed entirely from codebase.

**Rationale:**
1. **Semantic Type Mismatch**: P1 extraction produced semantic types (`fact`, `finding`, `insight`, `metric`) that were incompatible with P2's relationship ontology (`problem`, `constraint`, `solution`). Even relationship-rich data produced 0 relationships due to vocabulary misalignment.

2. **Minimal Integration**: P3 used relationships only for a single pattern check (≥3 relationships). P4 included them in prompts but degraded gracefully. Neither pipeline depended on relationships for core value.

3. **Canon Contradiction**: YARNNN_CANON.md line 112 explicitly stated P2 was replaced by Neural Map, yet full P2 implementation remained in codebase, creating architectural confusion.

4. **Semantic Search Superiority**: Embeddings provide more powerful substrate discovery than explicit relationships. P3/P4 use semantic similarity for context retrieval and composition.

5. **Simplicity**: Removing dual approaches (explicit relationships AND semantic search) reduces complexity and maintenance burden.

**What Replaced It:**
- **Neural Map** (client-side): Visual clustering of substrate by semantic type
- **Semantic Search** (server-side): Vector similarity for P1 duplicate detection, P3 context, P4 composition

**Impact:** Zero degradation. P3/P4 workflows unchanged. Simplified architecture aligns with Canon.

### V3.1 Semantic Layer: Core Upgrade

**What Changed:**
- **P1**: Semantic duplicate detection (merge vs create decisions based on vector similarity)
- **P3**: Semantic context retrieval (find relevant blocks without keyword matching)
- **P4**: Theme-based composition (semantic search for narrative coherence)
- **Visualization**: Neural Map replaces P2 graph inference (zero-cost brain-based clustering)

**What Didn't Change:**
- **P0**: Raw dumps remain unembedded (transient input, not persistent memory)
- **Governance**: All substrate mutations still flow through proposals
- **Structure**: Anchors, versioning, lifecycle still primary organizing principles

**Key Insight**: Semantic layer **augments** structured substrate, doesn't replace it. We're not building RAG—we're building structured memory with semantic intelligence.

### Pipeline Detail: P0→P1 Substrate Scaffolding

**P0: Capture Phase**
```
User Input → Collection of raw_dumps (unstructured)
- Text, PDFs, images become immutable raw_dumps
- Multiple inputs in one session linked by batch/provenance
- No interpretation, pure capture
```

**P1: Governed Evolution Phase (Propose → Commit) - V3.1 UPGRADED**
```
New raw_dumps + Existing substrate → Agent Analysis → Semantic Duplicate Detection → Governance Proposal → Approval → Substrate Evolution

1. Agent reads new raw_dumps collectively
2. Agent extracts facts/insights from dumps
3. V3.1: For each extracted fact, semantic search for similar existing blocks
   - similarity > 0.85 → Propose MERGE (high confidence duplicate)
   - similarity 0.70-0.85 → Propose UPDATE/ENRICH (related content)
   - similarity < 0.70 → Propose CREATE (novel content)
4. Agent determines evolution operations based on semantic analysis
5. Proposal approval → Operations executed atomically → Substrate evolved
6. V3.1: After block creation, generate embedding (for future searches)
```

**V3.0 Foundation**: All substrate unified into blocks table (semantic_type differentiates)
**V3.1 Upgrade**: Semantic duplicate detection via vector embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)

**Critical Insight**: P1 evolved from "extraction agent" → "intelligent substrate evolution agent". Semantic search enables detecting duplicates that keyword matching misses (e.g., "login failure" matches "authentication bug").

### Pipeline Detail: P3→P4 Artifact Generation

**P3: Insights Phase (Interpretive Intelligence)**
```
Substrate State + Reflections → Agent Analysis → P3 Insight Generation → Lineage Tracking

Insight Types:
1. insight_canon (basket-level): "What matters now in this basket?"
   - Cardinality: ONE current per basket (health invariant)
   - Regeneration: Creates new version, marks previous non-current
   - Freshness: Computed from substrate_hash + graph_signature changes

2. doc_insight (document-level): "What does this document mean?"
   - Cardinality: ONE per document (many documents = many insights)
   - Scope: Attached to specific document_id
   - Freshness: Recomputed when document's substrate_references change

3. timeboxed_insight (temporal): "What mattered in Q3 2025?"
   - Cardinality: MANY per basket (different time windows)
   - Scope: Explicit temporal_scope metadata
   - Freshness: Immutable for historical windows, active for current period

4. review_insight (governance): "Should this proposal be approved?"
   - Cardinality: ONE per proposal (ephemeral, computed on-demand)
   - Storage: Cached in proposals.review_insight (not in reflections_artifact)
   - Purpose: Internal governance intelligence only

5. Cross-basket insights (workspace-level): "What matters across all my contexts?"
   - Cardinality: ONE current per workspace
   - Scope: Synthesizes across all basket insight_canons
   - Policy-gated: Requires workspace_insight_enabled flag
```

**P4: Documents Phase (Composition & Activation)**
```
P3 Insights + Substrate → Agent Composition → P4 Document Generation → Versioning

Document Types:
1. document_canon (Basket Context Canon):
   - Cardinality: ONE per basket (mandatory health invariant)
   - Purpose: Authoritative narrative of basket state
   - Regeneration: Creates new version when substrate/insights change
   - Content: Lives in document_versions (immutable)

2. starter_prompt (Reasoning Capsules):
   - Cardinality: MANY per basket (multiple intents: strategy, marketing, technical)
   - Purpose: Reusable activation surfaces for external hosts (Claude, ChatGPT)
   - Composition: Canon + Insights + reasoning metadata (purpose, constraints, continuity)
   - Portability: Designed for cross-host reuse

3. artifact_other (Extensible):
   - Cardinality: MANY per basket
   - Purpose: Future document types without schema changes
```

**P3/P4 Freshness Model (Context-Driven, Not Time-Driven)**
```
Staleness = f(substrate_hash_changed, graph_topology_changed, temporal_scope_invalid)

# NOT time-based
❌ WRONG: if (now() - last_generated) > 7 days: regenerate()

# Context-based
✅ RIGHT: if (current_substrate_hash != insight.substrate_hash): regenerate()
✅ RIGHT: if (current_graph_signature != insight.graph_signature): regenerate()
```

## 🏛️ Architectural Pillars

### 1. Memory-First Architecture
- User thoughts emerge from captured substrate, not imposed structure
- **Substrate Layer**: Immutable memory (raw_dumps, blocks, timeline_events) — V3.0 unified
- **Artifact Layer**: Derived expressions (documents, reflections) that never become substrate
- Unidirectional flow: Substrate → Artifacts

### 2. Governance-Mediated Evolution 🔥
- **Sacred Principle**: ALL substrate mutations flow through governance framework
- **Workspace Control**: Users configure execution policies (auto/proposal/confidence routing)
- **Agent Intelligence Preservation**: Mandatory validation for all substrate changes
- **Confidence-Informed Routing**: High-confidence operations auto-execute within governance bounds
- **Cross-cutting Impact**: Governance affects every pipeline, workflow, and user interaction

### 3. Workspace-Scoped Security
- Single workspace per user (strong guarantee)
- All access via RLS policies on workspace_memberships
- Governance settings isolated per workspace
- No client-side data synthesis allowed

### 4. Event-Driven Consistency
- Every mutation emits timeline events
- Events flow: `timeline_events` → `events` → client subscriptions
- Governance decisions audited in timeline
- Single source of truth: the substrate tables

### 5. Substrate Work Orchestration (v2.3)
- **Substrate Endpoint**: `POST /api/work` - Substrate mutations flow through governance
- **Substrate Work Types**: P0_CAPTURE, P1_SUBSTRATE, P2_GRAPH, P3_REFLECTION, MANUAL_EDIT, PROPOSAL_REVIEW, TIMELINE_RESTORE
- **Artifact Work Types**: P4_COMPOSE_NEW, P4_RECOMPOSE (document operations)
- **Governance Integration**: Substrate work evaluated against workspace governance policies
- **Direct Artifact Operations** - Documents, reflections operate independently via dedicated endpoints
- **Status Visibility**: Complete traceability for substrate mutations, simple REST for artifacts

### Governance Architecture Detail

**Sacred Principle**: All substrate mutations flow through governed proposals

```
Raw Input → P0 Capture → P1 Proposal → Approval → Substrate Creation
```

**Proposal Structure** (Unapplied Changeset):
```typescript
interface Proposal {
  ops: Operation[]  // The substrate changes to apply
  status: 'PROPOSED' | 'APPROVED' | 'EXECUTED'
  origin: 'agent' | 'human'
  provenance: uuid[]  // Source raw_dump IDs
}
```

**Operation Schema** (P1 Evolution Agent Output) — V3.0:
```typescript
// Creation operations - novel concepts
{
  type: "CreateBlock",
  title: "Project Strategy",
  content: "New insight from dumps...",
  semantic_type: "insight" | "fact" | "entity" | "intent" | "metric",
  anchor_role: "strategy",  // V3.0: Emergent anchor (optional)
  anchor_status: "proposed",
  anchor_confidence: 0.85,
  confidence: 0.8
}

// Evolution operations - refining existing substrate
{
  type: "ReviseBlock",
  block_id: "existing-uuid",
  title: "Updated Project Strategy",
  content: "Updated content with new information...",
  parent_block_id: "existing-uuid",  // V3.0: Versioning chain
  confidence: 0.85
}

{
  type: "MergeBlocks",  // V3.0: Unified merge
  from_ids: ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  canonical_id: "uuid1",
  merged_content: "Combined understanding..."
}

{
  type: "UpdateBlock",
  block_id: "existing-uuid",
  title: "Refined Title",
  anchor_role: "updated-anchor",  // V3.0: Emergent anchors evolve
  confidence: 0.9
}
```

**V3.0 Changes**:
- No more `CreateContextItem` / `UpdateContextItem` / `MergeContextItems`
- All operations now target unified `blocks` table
- Emergent `anchor_role` replaces fixed categories
- Versioning via `parent_block_id` chains

**Approval Criteria**:
- Agent-generated proposals: Auto-approve if confidence > 0.7
- Human-generated proposals: Manual review required
- Operations executed atomically on approval

### 6. Pure Supabase Async Intelligence Model
- Raw dumps automatically trigger agent queue processing via database triggers
- Pure Supabase architecture: no DATABASE_URL dependency, single connection type
- Service role authentication for backend operations, anon role for user operations
- User experience is immediate, intelligence processing happens asynchronously
- Agent processing is mandatory for substrate creation per Sacred Principle #4
- Queue-based processing ensures YARNNN canon compliance at scale
- Frontend shows processing state but never synthesizes substrate

## 🎬 Operational Flow

### Basket Lifecycle
```
INIT → ACTIVE → ARCHIVED
```
- Empty INIT baskets > 48h are eligible for cleanup
- Baskets are workspace-level containers for cognitive work

### Block State Machine
```
PROPOSED → ACCEPTED → LOCKED → CONSTANT
         ↘         ↗
          REJECTED → SUPERSEDED
```

### Substrate Evolution Flow
- **Multi-Input Capture**: Text, files, images become collection of raw_dumps
- **Context-Aware Processing**: P1 Agent analyzes new dumps + existing substrate
- **Evolution Decisions**: Agent determines Create/Update/Merge operations needed
- **Governance Proposal**: Single proposal with mixed operation types based on basket maturity
- **Auto-Approval**: High confidence evolution proposals execute immediately
- **Substrate Evolution**: Operations evolve the basket's knowledge representation

**Operation Mix Over Basket Lifecycle**:
- **Early Stage (1-10 dumps)**: 90% Create, 10% Update - exploring new conceptual space
- **Growing Stage (10-50 dumps)**: 60% Create, 40% Update - filling out knowledge gaps  
- **Mature Stage (50+ dumps)**: 30% Create, 70% Update - refining existing knowledge

**Deletion & Retention**: User operations are Archive/Redact (governance‑first) with cascade preview and audit tombstones; physical deletion is policy‑driven via scheduled vacuum (developer‑level). See `docs/YARNNN_DELETION_RETENTION_CANON_v1.0.md`.

### Document Composition (Artifact Layer)
- Documents = independent artifacts composed from substrate ingredients + authored prose
- Git-inspired versioning: Documents create snapshots for stable references
- Substrate ingredients remain immutable; documents evolve independently
- P4 agent creates initial composition, users freely edit afterward

## 📝 Sacred Principle #5: Substrate Management Replaces Document Editing (v3.0)

### Philosophy

**Documents are read-only composed views of substrate state. Users do not edit documents—they manage substrate and direct composition.**

This is YARNNN's revolutionary stance: fundamentally different from Notion, Google Docs, and traditional note-taking apps.

### What Users Do Instead of Editing

**1. Curate Substrate** (replaces: "editing content")
- Approve/reject/merge blocks via governance
- Add/remove substrate references from documents
- Update blocks through proposals (V3.0: unified substrate)

**2. Direct Composition** (replaces: "formatting and structure")
- Define composition instructions ("make section 2 more technical")
- Select which substrate to include/exclude
- Request regeneration with updated parameters

**3. Govern Substrate Mutations** (replaces: "revising drafts")
- Review proposals for block updates
- Approve substrate merges and refinements
- Validate agent-extracted substrate

**4. Manage Versions** (replaces: "save and track changes")
- Freeze versions as final snapshots
- Compare versions to see substrate evolution
- Accept/reject regenerated compositions

### The Fundamental Shift

**Traditional (Notion/Docs):**
```
User types prose → saves → document updated
```

**YARNNN (Revolutionary):**
```
User curates substrate → requests composition → document regenerated
```

### Expected Time Allocation

- **80%** substrate curation (governance, building-blocks management)
- **20%** composition refinement (document regeneration, instruction tuning)

**Substrate management IS the primary user activity.** Documents are downstream artifacts of well-managed substrate.

### Three-Layer Mental Model

**Layer 1: RAW_DUMPS** (Immutable Capture)
- Purpose: Preserve original input exactly as received
- User interaction: View original (read-only reference)
- Location: `/baskets/[id]/timeline` (Uploads tab)

**Layer 2: SUBSTRATE** (Governed Knowledge)
- Purpose: Structured, validated knowledge atoms
- User interaction: Curate, approve, merge (governance)
- Location: `/baskets/[id]/building-blocks`

**Layer 3: DOCUMENTS** (Composed Artifacts)
- Purpose: Narrative compositions from substrate
- User interaction: Manage substrate, refine composition
- Location: `/baskets/[id]/documents/[doc-id]`

### Upload Wizard Transformation

When users upload existing documents (e.g., `product-spec.docx`):

1. **P0:** Create raw_dump with original text (preserved exactly)
2. **P1:** Extract substrate → Create proposals
3. **User:** Review and approve substrate (governance)
4. **P4:** Compose NEW document from extracted substrate
5. **Show:** Side-by-side diff (original vs YARNNN version)
6. **User:** Accept transformation or cancel upload

**Key Insight:** We don't "migrate" documents. We **transform** them into substrate-backed knowledge.

**Trust Model:** Transparency through side-by-side comparison builds confidence in substrate extraction quality.

## 💡 Key Insights from Canon

1. **Substrate Equality** - The three substrate types (dumps, blocks, events) are peers — V3.0 unified
2. **Substrate vs Artifacts** - Clear separation between memory (substrate) and expressions (artifacts)
3. **Read-Only Documents** - Documents are composed views, never directly edited (v3.0)
4. **Pipeline Discipline** - P0-P1 create substrate via governance, P3-P4 create artifacts
5. **Memory Permanence** - Substrate is immutable; documents regenerate from substrate changes
6. **Document Versioning** - Git-inspired immutable snapshots for stable artifact references
7. **Workspace Isolation** - Complete data isolation between workspaces
8. **Agent Necessity** - Substrate cannot exist without agent processing
9. **Async Intelligence** - User feedback is instant, intelligence processing happens asynchronously
10. **Governance-Mediated Creation** - All substrate mutations flow through proposals, enabling review and atomic execution
11. **Supervisory Work Model** - Users direct and govern; agents research and compose (v3.0)
12. **Semantic Intelligence** - Agents reason semantically, not just keyword matching (v3.1)
13. **Causal Graph** - Relationships capture "why" and "what depends on", not just "relates to" (v3.1)
14. **Structure + Semantics** - Semantic layer augments structure, doesn't replace it (v3.1)

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

1. **Frontend Must**:
   - Mirror durable server state only
   - Never synthesize data client-side
   - Respect substrate equality in UI

2. **Backend Must**:
   - Enforce pipeline write boundaries
   - Emit timeline events for every mutation
   - Maintain workspace isolation via RLS

3. **Agents Must**:
   - **P1 Evolution Agents (V3.1 UPGRADED)**:
     - Read new raw_dumps AND existing substrate in basket
     - V3.1: Use semantic search to detect duplicates (similarity > 0.85 = MERGE, 0.70-0.85 = UPDATE, <0.70 = CREATE)
     - Make intelligent Create/Update/Merge decisions based on semantic overlap, not just keyword matching
     - Use proper operation schema (flat structure, not nested objects)
     - Process actual dump content, never hardcoded templates
     - Achieve confidence > 0.7 for auto-approval eligibility
     - Handle basket lifecycle: heavy Create (early) → heavy Update (mature)

   - **P3 Insight Agents (V3.1 ENHANCED)**:
     - Use semantic search to retrieve relevant context (not full basket scan)
     - Generate insights with evidence from substrate

   - **P4 Composition Agents (V3.1 ENHANCED)**:
     - Use semantic search for theme-based retrieval (not just anchor_role filtering)
     - Create coherent narrative from substrate + P3 insights
     - Integrate workspace-level context via cross-basket semantic search

---

## 🧠 V3.1 Semantic Layer Architecture

**Purpose:** Enable agents to reason semantically about substrate, not just keyword matching

**See**: [SEMANTIC_LAYER_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md](./SEMANTIC_LAYER_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md) for complete technical architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Vector Embeddings (Semantic Search)

**What Gets Embedded:**
- `blocks` table ONLY (ACCEPTED+ state)
- NOT raw_dumps (transient input)
- NOT documents (derived artifacts)

**When Embedded:**
- After governance approval (state → ACCEPTED/LOCKED/CONSTANT)
- Async generation via OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)
- Stored in `blocks.embedding` column

**Purpose:**
- Semantic duplicate detection (P1)
- Theme-based retrieval (P3, P4)
- Cross-basket pattern discovery (P1, P3)

**Key Principle:** Embed substrate (refined knowledge), not raw input

---

#### 2. Relationship Graph (Causal Semantics)

**Relationship Types (4 Core):**

| Type | From Types | To Types | Description |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `addresses` | action, insight, objective, solution | problem, constraint, issue | Solution addresses problem |
| `supports` | fact, finding, metric, evidence | objective, insight, hypothesis | Evidence supports claim |
| `contradicts` | fact, finding, insight | assumption, fact, insight | Conflicts with statement |
| `depends_on` | action, objective, task | action, objective, constraint | Prerequisite dependency |

**Inference Process:**
1. P2 agent analyzes new blocks after P1 substrate creation
2. Semantic search finds relationship candidates (similarity > 0.70)
3. LLM verification (gpt-4o-mini) confirms causal relationship
4. Propose via governance (auto-accept if confidence > 0.90)

**Purpose:**
- Causal reasoning (P3 insights)
- Narrative coherence (P4 documents)
- Decision tracing ("why did we decide X?")

**Key Principle:** Relationships capture causality, not just association

---

#### 3. Shared Primitives (API Layer)

All agents use standardized semantic layer API:

```python
# Semantic search within basket
semantic_search(basket_id, query_text, filters, limit)
→ List[BlockWithSimilarity]

# Cross-basket search (elevated scope)
semantic_search_cross_basket(workspace_id, query_text, scopes, limit)
→ List[BlockWithSimilarity]

# Infer relationships for block
infer_relationships(block_id, basket_id)
→ List[RelationshipProposal]

# Traverse relationship graph
traverse_relationships(start_block_id, relationship_type, direction, max_depth)
→ List[BlockWithDepth]

# Get rich semantic context
get_semantic_context(focal_block_id, context_window)
→ {similar_blocks, relationships}
```

**Location:** `api/src/services/semantic_primitives.py`

### Integration Points by Pillar

#### P0: Capture - NO CHANGES
- Raw dumps not embedded (transient input, not persistent memory)
- Pure capture remains pure

#### P1: Substrate Evolution - UPGRADED
**Before:** Extract facts → propose CREATE operations
**After:** Extract facts → semantic search for duplicates → propose CREATE/MERGE/UPDATE

**Thresholds:**
- similarity > 0.85 → MERGE (high confidence duplicate)
- similarity 0.70-0.85 → UPDATE/ENRICH (related content)
- similarity < 0.70 → CREATE (novel content)

**Impact:** 30-40% reduction in duplicate blocks

#### P3: Insights - ENHANCED
**Before:** Analyze all blocks in basket
**After:** Semantic retrieval → analyze patterns → generate insights

**Features:**
- Context retrieval without keyword matching
- Pattern recognition across substrate types
- Evidence-based insight generation

**Impact:** Richer insights with semantic pattern recognition

#### P4: Documents - ENHANCED
**Before:** Retrieve blocks by anchor_role
**After:** Semantic theme search → compose coherent narrative

**Features:**
- Theme-based retrieval (not just anchor tags)
- Narrative flow from substrate patterns
- Workspace context integration (elevated scope)

**Impact:** More coherent documents with semantic structure

---

### Design Principles (Reaffirmed)

1. **Embed Substrate, Not Raw Input**
   - Quality over quantity
   - ACCEPTED+ blocks only (vetted knowledge)

2. **Agent-First, Not User-First**
   - Primary value: Agent intelligence
   - Secondary value: User features (find similar, graph viz)

3. **Structure + Semantics, Not RAG**
   - Governance, versioning, anchors remain primary
   - Semantic layer augments, doesn't replace

4. **Deliberate Integration**
   - Each pillar explicitly defines semantic usage
   - Shared primitives with clear contracts
   - Integration points documented

---

### Success Metrics

**P1 (Substrate Evolution):**
- Duplicate block rate: <5% (down from ~15%)
- Merge proposal rate: >25% (up from ~5%)

**P3 (Insights):**
- Context relevance: >85% (% retrieved blocks relevant)
- Pattern recognition: Insights identify emergent themes

**P4 (Documents):**

## Governance Evolution (v2.0 Preview)

**See**: `YARNNN_GOVERNANCE_CANON.md` for substrate governance model evolution

**Key Evolution**: Governance as first-class workflow
- All substrate mutations flow through governed proposals
- Agent validation mandatory for all proposals (agent + human origin)
- V3.0: All blocks have governance states: `PROPOSED → ACCEPTED → LOCKED → CONSTANT`
- Unified governance preserves sacred capture path while enabling manual substrate curation

**V3.0 Changes**: Unified blocks table with emergent anchors replaces context_items

## ⚙️ Universal Work Orchestration (v2.2)

**The Governance Revolution**: ALL substrate mutations flow through a single orchestrated pipeline.

### Core Concept: Work-Type Based Governance

```typescript
interface WorkRequest {
  work_type: 'P0_CAPTURE' | 'P1_SUBSTRATE' | 'P2_GRAPH' | 'P3_REFLECTION' | 
            'P4_COMPOSE' | 'MANUAL_EDIT' | 'PROPOSAL_REVIEW' | 'TIMELINE_RESTORE'
  work_payload: {
    operations: Operation[]     // What substrate changes to make
    basket_id: string          // Workspace context
    confidence_score?: number  // AI confidence level
    user_override?: 'require_review' | 'allow_auto'
    provenance?: string[]      // Source raw_dumps or context
  }
}
```

### Governance Policy Framework

Each workspace has governance policies that determine execution mode:

```typescript
interface WorkTypePolicy {
  mode: 'auto' | 'proposal' | 'confidence'
  confidence_threshold: number  // Used in confidence mode
  require_validation: boolean   // Manual validator required
}
```

**Mode Behaviors:**
- `auto`: Execute immediately (like git auto-merge)
- `proposal`: Always create proposal for review (like git pull request)
- `confidence`: Route based on AI confidence score within governance framework

### Universal Routing Algorithm

```
1. Work Request → Universal Work API (/api/work)
2. Fetch workspace governance policy for work_type
3. Apply routing logic:
   - user_override takes precedence
   - otherwise use policy.mode
   - confidence mode uses confidence_threshold
4. Route to execution path:
   - auto_execute → immediate substrate modification
   - create_proposal → create review proposal
5. Emit timeline events for visibility
6. Return work_id and routing decision
```

### Sacred Principles Enforcement

1. **Substrate-Only Governance**: No direct substrate endpoints exist - substrate mutations flow through `/api/work`
2. **Artifact Independence**: Documents and reflections use direct REST endpoints (`/api/documents`, `/api/reflections`)
3. **User Control**: Governance policies are user-configurable per workspace for substrate operations only
4. **Confidence Integration**: AI confidence informs substrate routing but doesn't override governance

### Canon-Pure Patterns (v2.3)

**SUBSTRATE OPERATIONS (Governed):**
- Substrate mutations: `/api/work` → governance → substrate tables
- Work types: P0_CAPTURE, P1_SUBSTRATE, P2_GRAPH, P3_REFLECTION, MANUAL_EDIT

**ARTIFACT OPERATIONS (Independent):**
- Document CRUD: `/api/documents` → direct → documents table
- Document composition: P4 agents → direct → document updates
- Reflection generation: `/api/reflections` → direct → reflections table
- Analytics: Direct queries to composition_stats, substrate_references

**ELIMINATED Canon Violations:**
- Document creation through governance ❌ → Direct REST endpoints ✅
- Reflection proposals ❌ → Direct computation ✅  
- Universal governance for artifacts ❌ → Substrate-only governance ✅

## Version Lock

- Canon version: **v3.1**
- Frozen as of: **2025-10-13**
- Update policy: Do not edit in place. Amendments require a new canon version.

### v3.1.0 Changes (P3/P4 Taxonomy & Immutability Hardening)
- **P3 Insights Taxonomy Formalized**: insight_canon, doc_insight, timeboxed_insight, review_insight, cross-basket insights
- **P4 Documents Taxonomy Formalized**: document_canon (mandatory), starter_prompt (many), artifact_other (extensible)
- **Context-Driven Freshness**: Staleness computed from substrate_hash + graph_signature changes, NOT time-based
- **Lineage Tracking**: All P3/P4 artifacts link to previous versions via previous_id
- **Provenance Recording**: All artifacts record derived_from (substrate sources)
- **Cardinality Clarity**: ONE insight_canon per basket/workspace, MANY doc_insights per basket, MANY starter_prompts
- **Review Insights Scoped**: Computed ephemeral, cached in proposals table (not in reflections_artifact)
- **Cross-Basket Synthesis**: Workspace-level insights schema included (policy-gated for future enablement)
- **Governance Boundary Hardened**: P3/P4 regeneration is DIRECT (not governed), policy-controlled only
- **Basket Modes Eliminated**: Removed legacy preset/template patterns in favor of emergent P3/P4 intelligence

### v3.0.0 Changes (Revolutionary - Substrate-First Documents)
- **Sacred Principle #5 Added**: Substrate Management Replaces Document Editing
- **Document Model Revolution**: Documents are read-only composed views, never directly edited
- **Upload Wizard Transformation**: Uploaded documents transformed via substrate extraction, not preserved as-is
- **Three-Layer Mental Model**: raw_dumps (capture) → substrate (knowledge) → documents (compositions)
- **Schema Evolution**: Documents table becomes composition definitions; content lives in immutable versions
- **Supervisory Work Model**: Users curate substrate 80%, refine compositions 20%
- **Fundamental Differentiation**: YARNNN is not Notion—it's substrate-first intelligence platform

### v2.3.0 Changes (Clarification & Canon Purity)
- **Substrate/Artifact Separation**: Clarified governance applies ONLY to substrate layer
- **Artifact Independence**: Documents and reflections operate via direct REST, not governance
- **Canon-Pure Boundaries**: Eliminated universal governance violation of artifact autonomy
- **P4 Reclassification**: Document composition moved from governance to direct artifact operations
- **Documentation Hardening**: Crystal clear boundaries prevent future canon violations

### v2.2.0 Changes (Revolutionary)
- **Universal Work Orchestration**: ALL substrate mutations flow through single governance pipeline
- **Work-Type Based Governance**: Replaced entry-point routing with universal work type policies
- **Eliminated Dual Approaches**: Deleted all legacy direct substrate endpoints
- **Enhanced User Control**: Workspace-level governance configuration with confidence sub-options
- **Canon Purity**: Complete elimination of governance bypass patterns

### v2.1.0 Changes (Extension)
- **Universal Work Orchestration**: Extended canonical_queue to handle all async operations
- **Real-time Status Visibility**: Canon-compliant status derivation across all workflows  
- **Cascade Framework Integration**: Unified P0→P1→P2→P3 orchestration with status tracking
- **Schema Enhancement**: Extended canonical_queue with cascade metadata and universal work support
- **Sacred Principle Preservation**: All changes maintain strict canon compliance

### v3.0.0 Changes (Breaking) — 2025-01-15
- **Unified Substrate Architecture**: `context_items` merged into `blocks` table
- **Three Pure Substrates**: raw_dumps, blocks (unified), timeline_events
- **Emergent Anchors**: Free-text `anchor_role` replaces fixed categorization
- **Universal Versioning**: All blocks version identically via `parent_block_id` chains
- **Scope Elevation**: Cross-basket memory via WORKSPACE/ORG/GLOBAL scopes
- **Semantic Types**: Knowledge (fact, metric), Meaning (intent, objective), Structural (entity)
- **See**: [YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md](./YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md) for complete details

### v2.0.0 Changes (Breaking)
- **Substrate/Artifact Separation**: Clear distinction between memory (substrate) and expressions (artifacts)
- **Two Artifact Types**: documents (versioned), reflections (computed)
- **Document Versioning**: Git-inspired versioning for stable artifact references
- **Legacy Table Removal**: Eliminated block_links, document_context_items, basket_events, revisions
- **No Artifact Recursion**: Reflections can target substrates OR document versions, never other artifacts

### v1.4.0 Changes
- Added Pure Supabase Async Intelligence Model as 5th Architectural Pillar
- Updated to reflect queue-based agent processing architecture 
- Clarified service role vs anon role authentication patterns
- Reinforced Agent Intelligence Mandatory principle (#4)
- **Memory Page Evolution**: Transformed primary operating surface into comprehensive memory interface
