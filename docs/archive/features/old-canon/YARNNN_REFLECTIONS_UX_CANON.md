# YARNNN Reflections UX Canon

## Core Purpose
Reflections reveal meaningful patterns, tensions, and insights about **the user's actual work and thinking** - not technical system metadata.

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Focus on Content, Not System Structure
**Wrong**: "Memory analysis of 5 substrate elements reveals emerging patterns in conceptual_development"  
**Right**: "Your Q4 planning documents show tension between ambitious revenue goals and conservative hiring plans"

### 2. Speak About the User's Work
Reflections should reference:
- **User's actual content**: document names, project themes, goals mentioned
- **User's patterns**: recurring topics, evolving ideas, repeated concerns  
- **User's context**: their specific domain, challenges, and objectives

**Never reference**: substrate elements, semantic relationships, knowledge graphs, system metadata

### 3. Identify Meaningful Patterns
Good reflection types:
- **Tensions**: "Your cost-cutting initiatives conflict with your quality improvement goals"
- **Evolution**: "Your thinking on remote work has shifted from skeptical to supportive over 3 months"
- **Gaps**: "You've planned extensively for Q1-Q3 but Q4 strategy is still unclear"
- **Themes**: "Sustainability appears in 7 documents but isn't in your stated priorities"
- **Questions**: "How will you balance rapid growth with team well-being?"

### 4. Be Specific and Actionable
**Vague**: "Emerging patterns in strategic thinking"  
**Specific**: "Your January planning emphasized 'stability' but recent notes focus on 'aggressive expansion' - worth clarifying priorities"

**Abstract**: "Knowledge ecosystem showing maturity"  
**Actionable**: "You have solid research on market trends but no implementation timeline - consider next steps"

### 5. Use Natural Language
- Write like a thoughtful colleague, not a computer system
- Reference specific content the user will recognize
- Avoid technical terminology completely
- Make it conversational and helpful

## Reflection Content Guidelines

### Pattern Recognition
Look for:
- **Recurring themes**: Topics mentioned across multiple documents
- **Contradictions**: Goals or ideas that conflict with each other
- **Evolution**: How thinking has changed over time
- **Missing pieces**: Important topics that seem absent
- **Connections**: Related ideas that might not be obviously linked

### Language Standards
Always use:
- User's own terminology and project names
- Specific document references ("In your Marketing Strategy doc...")
- Clear, jargon-free explanations
- Constructive, helpful tone

Never use:
- "substrate", "semantic relationships", "conceptual_development"
- System metadata or technical structure descriptions
- Generic "knowledge ecosystem" language
- Abstract or vague observations

### Example Templates

**Tension Pattern**:
"Your [specific goal A] and [specific goal B] seem to pull in different directions. In [document], you emphasize [quote/detail], but [other document] suggests [conflicting point]."

**Evolution Pattern**:
"Your approach to [topic] has shifted over time. Earlier notes show [perspective], while recent content suggests [new perspective]. This evolution might be worth documenting."

**Gap Pattern**:
"You've thoroughly explored [area] but haven't addressed [related important area]. This might be worth investigating given your focus on [goal]."

**Theme Pattern**:
"[Theme] appears consistently across your work - in [doc1], [doc2], and [doc3] - but isn't explicitly part of your stated priorities. Consider whether this should be elevated."

## Technical Translation Rules

Since the backend still thinks in technical terms, the frontend should translate:

| Backend Analysis | User-Facing Translation |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "5 substrate elements" | "Your recent uploads" |
| "semantic relationships detected" | "Connected themes found" |
| "conceptual_development patterns" | "Evolution in your thinking" |
| "knowledge structuring activity" | "Organization of your ideas" |
| "substrate connectivity metrics" | "How your ideas relate" |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **System-centric**: "Database contains 47 relationships between 12 entities"  
✅ **User-centric**: "Your project planning connects to 6 different team goals"

❌ **Generic**: "Patterns detected in knowledge base"  
✅ **Specific**: "Your Q3 reviews all mention capacity constraints"

❌ **Technical**: "Clustering algorithm identified thematic groups"  
✅ **Meaningful**: "Three main concerns emerge from your team feedback"

❌ **Abstract**: "Cognitive load optimization opportunities exist"  
✅ **Actionable**: "You're tracking too many metrics - consider focusing on the top 3"

This canon ensures reflections provide genuine value to users rather than confusing technical analysis.
