# YARNNN Timeline Canon

## Core Purpose
The timeline shows **what's happening with your knowledge** - not technical events, but meaningful progress on your ideas.

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Human-Readable Stories, Not Technical Logs
**Wrong**: "event_type: dump.created at 14:23:45"  
**Right**: "You added 'Marketing Strategy Q4.pdf' ‚Üí AI is reading it now"

### 2. Show Cause and Effect
Every timeline entry should clearly show:
- **Trigger**: What the user did (uploaded, wrote, asked)
- **Process**: What the AI is doing (reading, analyzing, connecting)
- **Outcome**: What the user got (new insights, connections found, document created)

### 3. Use Consistent User-Facing Language
Must match terminology from other pages exactly:
- `dumps` ‚Üí "Source Notes" or "uploads"
- `context_items` ‚Üí "Meanings" 
- `blocks` ‚Üí "Building Blocks"
- `relationships` ‚Üí "Connections"
- `reflections` ‚Üí "Reflections"
- `documents` ‚Üí "Documents"

### 4. Group by User Intent, Not Technical IDs
Events should be grouped by what the user was trying to accomplish, not by system IDs:
- Group events within 30 seconds of a user action
- Show the user action as the parent
- Indent AI processing steps below

### 5. Make It Actionable
Every timeline item should answer: "What can I do with this?"
- Failed? ‚Üí Retry button
- Completed? ‚Üí View results link
- Processing? ‚Üí Show progress

## Event Translation Guide

### Technical Events ‚Üí User Language
This mapping ensures consistency across all timeline implementations:

| Technical Event | User Sees | Example |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| `dump.created` | "Added [source]" | "Added Marketing Strategy Q4.pdf" |
| `dump.queued` | "Processing..." | "AI is reading your file..." |
| `block.created` | "Found insight" | "Found insight: Q4 revenue targets" |
| `context_item.created` | "Tagged concept" | "Tagged as 'Quarterly Planning'" |
| `relationship.created` | "Connected ideas" | "Connected to your Annual Goals" |
| `reflection.computed` | "Generated reflection" | "New reflection on growth patterns" |
| `document.created` | "Created document" | "Created summary document" |
| `queue.processing_started` | "AI started working" | "AI started analyzing..." |
| `queue.processing_completed` | "Finished processing" | "‚úì Analysis complete" |
| `queue.processing_failed` | "Couldn't process" | "‚ö†Ô∏è Couldn't read file" |

### Processing Chain Example
Instead of showing individual technical events, group them into stories:

**User sees:**
```
üìÑ You added "Product Roadmap.pdf" (2 minutes ago)
  ‚îî‚îÄ ü§ñ AI is analyzing the document...
      ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úì Found 5 key concepts
      ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úì Created 3 building blocks
      ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úì Connected to your "Product Strategy" meaning
      ‚îî‚îÄ View results ‚Üí
```

**NOT:**
```
dump.created - dump_3fa2
queue.entry_created - queue_8b5c
block.created - block_9d2e
context_item.created - ctx_4a1f
relationship.created - rel_7c3d
```

## Current State (Completed)

### ‚úÖ Core Implementation
- **Fixed cursor pagination** - Timeline load more now works properly with ISO timestamp format
- **Removed redundant headers** - Clean single header pattern with SubpageHeader component
- **Added pipeline filtering** - Filter by P0-P4 stages + Queue processing
- **Processing status indicators** - Active processing bar, success rates, duration metrics
- **Enhanced event display** - Processing duration, error messages, source tracking, agent confidence

### ‚úÖ Architectural Foundations
- **Clear page boundaries** - Timeline focuses on "processing intelligence" vs content details
- **Governance integration** - Timeline shows governance-related events when enabled
- **Notification separation** - Timeline and notifications are architecturally distinct

## Timeline's Unique Value Proposition

The timeline page answers these specific questions:
- **"What's happening right now?"** - Real-time processing status
- **"How efficient is my knowledge processing?"** - Performance metrics
- **"Where are the bottlenecks?"** - Processing delays and failures  
- **"How are the agents performing?"** - Agent confidence and success rates

### What Timeline Should NOT Show (Belongs in Other Pages)
- ‚ùå Actual content details (Building Blocks page)
- ‚ùå Relationship structures (Graph page)
- ‚ùå Final documents (Memory page)
- ‚ùå Change proposals (Governance page)

## Interactive Features - Recommendations

### Priority 1: Processing Control Actions
```typescript
// For failed processing events
<Button onClick={() => retryProcessing(event.ref_id)}>
  Retry Processing
</Button>

// For active processing events  
<Button onClick={() => cancelProcessing(event.ref_id)}>
  Cancel
</Button>
```

### Priority 2: Navigation Links
```typescript
// Jump to related entities
{event.event_type === "block.created" && (
  <Link href={`/baskets/${basketId}/building-blocks#${event.ref_id}`}>
    View Block
  </Link>
)}

{event.event_type === "reflection.computed" && (
  <Link href={`/baskets/${basketId}/reflections#${event.ref_id}`}>
    View Insights
  </Link>
)}
```

### Priority 3: Expandable Processing Details
```typescript
// Click to expand technical details
const [expandedEvent, setExpandedEvent] = useState<string | null>(null);

{expandedEvent === event.id && (
  <div className="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded">
    <h4>Processing Details</h4>
    <pre className="text-xs">{JSON.stringify(event.event_data, null, 2)}</pre>
  </div>
)}
```

### Priority 4: Consumer-Friendly Revert (Future)
Instead of git-like UX, think:
- **"Undo this change"** - Simple undo button on recent substrate events
- **"Restore to 1 hour ago"** - Time-based restoration
- **"Remove this addition"** - For unwanted blocks/context items

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Data Structure
```typescript
interface TimelineEventDTO {
  id: string;
  event_type: string; // "queue.processing_started", "block.created", etc.
  event_data: Record<string, unknown>; // Processing metadata
  created_at: string;
  processing_agent?: string; // P0/P1/P2/P3
  agent_confidence?: number;
  description?: string; // Agent-computed
  ref_id?: string; // Links to created entity
}
```

### Processing Statistics Implementation
- **Active Processing Count** - Events with "processing_started" but no corresponding "completed"
- **Success Rate** - Ratio of completed vs failed events (24h window)
- **Duration Tracking** - When event_data includes duration_ms

### API Integration Points
- `/api/baskets/[id]/timeline` - Main timeline data
- `/api/canonical/queue/health` - Processing system status
- `/api/proposals/[id]/retry` - Retry failed processing (future)
- `/api/processing/[id]/cancel` - Cancel active processing (future)

## Notification System Separation

### Timeline vs Notifications
- **Timeline**: Detailed processing history and current status (this page)
- **Notifications**: Badge count + quick preview in profile circle (future)

### Notification Architecture (Future)
```typescript
// In profile picture component
const [notificationCount, setNotificationCount] = useState(0);
const [recentEvents, setRecentEvents] = useState<TimelineEventDTO[]>([]);

// Real-time subscription to new events
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('timeline_notifications')
    .on('postgres_changes', { 
      event: 'INSERT', 
      schema: 'public', 
      table: 'timeline_events',
      filter: `basket_id=eq.${basketId}`
    }, (payload) => {
      setNotificationCount(prev => prev + 1);
      // Show brief toast notification
    })
    .subscribe();
}, [basketId]);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Load more pagination** - Works but limited to 50 events per request
- **Client-side filtering** - Should move to backend for large datasets
- **Real-time updates** - Not implemented (manual refresh required)

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Virtual scrolling** for large event lists
- **WebSocket subscription** for real-time processing updates
- **Background refresh** to keep processing status current
- **Event aggregation** to reduce noise (group related events)

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Interactions (Next Session)
1. **Expandable event details** - Click to see processing metadata
2. **Retry failed processing** - Action buttons for failed events
3. **Navigation links** - Jump to created entities
4. **Real-time status updates** - WebSocket for active processing

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **Processing analytics** - Trends, performance charts
2. **Event grouping** - Collapse related processing chains
3. **Custom time ranges** - "Show last 6 hours" filtering
4. **Export timeline data** - For debugging/analysis

### Phase 3: Consumer Revert System
1. **Undo recent changes** - Time-based restoration
2. **Change preview** - Show what will be reverted
3. **Selective revert** - Choose specific changes to undo
4. **Revert impact analysis** - Show what depends on changes

## Technical Debt & Cleanup

### Database Schema
- **Event payload normalization** - Standardize event_data structure
- **Processing chain tracking** - Link related events (dump ‚Üí blocks ‚Üí relationships)
- **User activity tracking** - Track last_viewed_at for notification counts

### Code Cleanup
- **Remove unused pipelineFilter state** from UnifiedTimeline (now passed as prop)
- **Standardize event configuration** - Move EVENT_CONFIG to shared constants
- **Type safety improvements** - Proper typing for event_data based on event_type

## Key Architectural Insights

### Timeline as Processing Intelligence Center
The timeline page serves as the "control tower" for knowledge processing:
- Shows what the AI agents are doing
- Provides visibility into processing health
- Enables intervention when things go wrong
- Tracks performance over time

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Timeline**: Process monitoring and control
- **Building Blocks**: Content viewing and editing  
- **Graph**: Relationship exploration
- **Memory**: Final document consumption
- **Governance**: Change approval workflow
- **Notifications**: Quick alerts and recent activity summary

This separation ensures each page has a focused purpose and avoids feature bloat.
