                    YARNNN Backend API

**Management Principle:** The YARNNN web application remains the source of
truth for basket management (anchors, naming, governance). MCP adapters are
ambient extensionsâ€”they may offer convenience actions (confirm basket, switch,
create new) but should redirect to the web UI for any deeper intervention.
```

- The **core** package owns protocol-neutral logic: tool schemas, input validation, 
  backend request helpers, and shared types.
- Each **adapter** wires that core into a specific host:
- `@yarnnn/anthropic-mcp` exposes the tools over the Model Context Protocol (stdio or HTTP/SSE).
- `@yarnnn/openai-apps` (scaffold) will wrap the same tools with the OpenAI Apps SDK once OAuth and UI wiring are complete.
- The OpenAI adapter now ships an embedded UI bundle (`ui/`) that ChatGPT can render once the Apps SDK contract is final; build it via `npm --prefix mcp-server/adapters/openai-apps/ui run build`.
- Both adapters call the same backend endpoints (`/api/mcp/...`), keeping the service contract identical regardless of AI platform. Basket inference is served via `/api/mcp/baskets/infer`, which returns scored candidates derived from canonical basket signatures.
- ChatGPT installs persist their OAuth tokens via `/api/integrations/openai/tokens`, secured with the shared `MCP_SHARED_SECRET` between adapter and backend.
