# YARNNN Platform Canon v4.0 — The AI Work Platform

**The Single Source of Truth for YARNNN Service Philosophy and Implementation**

**Version**: 4.0 (Major Paradigm Shift)
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: ✅ Canonical
**Supersedes**: YARNNN_CANON.md (v3.1)

---

## 🎯 Core Identity

**YARNNN is an AI Work Platform where deep context understanding enables superior agent supervision and work quality.**

We are **not** just a context OS. We are **not** just agent orchestration. We are the **integration** of both—where context and work create emergent value that neither achieves alone.

### The Strategic Positioning

**The Thesis**: Context understanding + Work supervision = Superior AI outcomes

---

## 🌟 The Five Sacred Principles (v4.0)

### 1. **Work Quality is Sacred**

Agent work requires human review before updating context. We supervise AI workers, not just store their outputs.

**Why**: Agents make mistakes. Context pollution is permanent. Human judgment remains essential for quality assurance.

**Manifestation**:
- All agent work flows through `work_sessions`
- Artifacts await approval before substrate application
- Multi-checkpoint supervision for iterative feedback
- Risk assessment guides review attention

### 2. **Context Enables Intelligence**

Deep substrate understanding improves agent reasoning quality. Context is not just storage—it's the foundation for better work.

**Why**: Agents with access to rich, structured context produce higher-quality outputs than those with raw retrieval.

**Manifestation**:
- Task documents (P4) provide narrative context envelopes
- Blocks provide granular facts
- Semantic layer enables intelligent relationship discovery
- Timeline provides temporal context

### 3. **Governance Spans Both**

Single approval handles work quality AND context mutation. No redundant double-governance.

**Why**: Reviewing agent work IS reviewing substrate changes. Separating them creates friction and confusion.

**Manifestation**:
- Unified approval orchestrator
- Work review → automatic substrate application
- Per-artifact decisions (apply/draft/reject)
- Single audit trail for both concerns

### 4. **Provenance is Mandatory**

Every artifact traces back to work session, agent reasoning, and source context. Complete accountability.

**Why**: Without provenance, debugging is impossible, trust erodes, and quality improvement stalls.

**Manifestation**:
- `work_artifacts` link to `work_sessions`
- `work_context_mutations` track substrate changes
- Timeline events capture agent decisions
- Agent SDK session IDs enable cross-system tracing

### 5. **Supervision is Iterative**

Multi-checkpoint feedback loops improve work quality through conversation, not binary approve/reject.

**Why**: Complex work requires course correction. Iteration beats single-shot judgment.

**Manifestation**:
- Checkpoint types: plan approval, mid-work review, final approval
- `work_iterations` capture feedback loops
- Agent revises based on user feedback
- Configurable approval strategies per user/agent

## 🚀 User Mental Model

### The Core Journey

```
[1. Create Task]
      ↓
   User defines intent: "Research AI memory competitors"
      ↓
[2. Agent Works]

      ↓
[4. Context Updates]
      ↓
   Approved artifacts → substrate (blocks created/updated)
   Timeline event emitted
   Substrate hash updated
   Documents marked stale (if needed)
      ↓
[5. Continuous Improvement]
      ↓
   Agent track record improves
   Trust calibration enables auto-approve for low-risk work

```

### Key User Questions Answered

**"How do I use YARNNN?"**
Create tasks for agents. Review their work. Approved work becomes your knowledge base.

**"What makes YARNNN different?"**
Your agents have access to all your context, not just what fits in a prompt. You supervise work quality once, not context changes separately.

**"Why not just use ChatGPT with RAG?"**
ChatGPT doesn't track work sessions, doesn't require approval, doesn't maintain lineage, and doesn't update your knowledge base. YARNNN is a platform, not a chat interface.

**"What about agent autonomy?"**
Agents work autonomously but outputs require approval. Think "employee with autonomy" not "automation without oversight."

## 🎯 Key Differentiators (Competitive Moat)

### 1. Single Approval for Work + Context

**The Problem**: Traditional systems require double-approval
- Step 1: Approve agent's work output
- Step 2: Approve updating your knowledge base
- Result: Friction, confusion, abandonment

**YARNNN Solution**: Unified governance
- Single review: "Is this good work?"
- If yes → Work approved AND context updated
- Result: Efficient, intuitive, high-adoption

### 2. Multi-Checkpoint Iterative Supervision

**The Problem**: Binary approve/reject loses nuance
- Agent does 2 hours of work
- User rejects because step 1 was wrong
- Agent must redo everything

**YARNNN Solution**: Checkpoints
- Plan approval: "Is this approach right?"
- Mid-work review: "Course correct before continuing"
- Final approval: "Apply to context"
- Result: Efficient iteration, less wasted work

### 3. Complete Work Provenance

**The Problem**: Agent outputs are black boxes
- "Why did the agent say this?"
- "What context did it use?"
- "Can I trust this?"

**YARNNN Solution**: Full lineage
- Every artifact links to work session
- Every session captures reasoning trail
- Every substrate mutation tracked
- Agent SDK session IDs enable deep debugging
- Result: Trust through transparency

### 4. Context-Powered Agent Reasoning

**The Problem**: RAG is not enough
- Simple retrieval misses relationships
- No semantic understanding
- No temporal context
- No narrative composition

**YARNNN Solution**: Substrate + Semantic Layer
- Blocks provide structured knowledge
- Semantic layer discovers relationships
- Timeline provides temporal context
- P4 documents compose narratives
- Result: Agents reason better, produce better work

## 📊 What Stays from v3.1

### Substrate Architecture (Layer 1) — Unchanged

**We're not throwing away our foundation.** The substrate model from v3.1 is solid:

- ✅ **Blocks** - Universal substrate (all semantic types)
- ✅ **Raw Dumps** - Immutable capture
- ✅ **Timeline Events** - Activity stream
- ✅ **Semantic Layer** - Embeddings + relationships
- ✅ **Documents (P4)** - Immutable compositions
- ✅ **Insights (P3)** - Reflections and synthesis

**See**: [YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md](../../YARNNN_SUBSTRATE_CANON_V3.md) for complete substrate reference.

### Core Principles That Evolved

| v3.1 Principle | v4.0 Evolution |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Capture is Sacred" | → "Work Quality is Sacred" (broader scope) |
| "All Substrates are Peers" | ✅ Unchanged (still true) |
| "Narrative is Deliberate" | ✅ Unchanged (P4 documents still composed) |
| "Agent Intelligence is Mandatory" | → "Context Enables Intelligence" (reframed) |
| "Substrate Management Replaces Document Editing" | → "Supervision Replaces Manual Work" (evolved) |

## 🔄 What's New in v4.0

### Layer 2: Work Orchestration

**Concept**: Agent work is a first-class entity requiring lifecycle management.

**Components**:
- `work_sessions` - Track agent execution (task → work → completion)
- `work_artifacts` - Agent outputs awaiting review
- `work_checkpoints` - Multi-stage approval workflow
- `work_iterations` - Feedback loops and revisions
- `work_context_mutations` - Audit trail of substrate changes

**Why**: In v3.1, agent work was implicit (just "process dumps"). Now it's explicit, governed, and traceable.

### Layer 3: Unified Governance

**Concept**: Single approval handles both work quality and context integrity.

**Pattern**: Work Review → Substrate Application
- User reviews: "Is this good work?" (reasoning, completeness, accuracy)
- If approved: Artifacts automatically applied to substrate
- Blocks created in `ACCEPTED` state (no separate proposal)
- Timeline event captures both work approval and substrate mutation

**Why**: In v3.1, governance was substrate-only (blocks/proposals). Now it spans work quality too.

### Agent SDK Integration

**Concept**: Clean integration with external agent execution frameworks.

**Pattern**: Session Linking
- Agent SDK manages execution (Claude conversations, tool use)
- YARNNN manages work lifecycle (artifacts, approval, substrate)
- Linked via `work_sessions.agent_session_id`
- Enables cross-system tracing and debugging

**Why**: In v3.1, agents were internal-only. Now we support external agent frameworks.

## 📖 Conceptual Glossary

### Core Concepts

**Work Session**: Agent execution lifecycle (task → artifacts → review → completion)

**Work Artifact**: Agent output awaiting approval (block proposal, document, insight, external file)

**Checkpoint**: Approval point during work session (plan approval, mid-work review, final approval)

**Iteration**: Feedback loop where user requests changes and agent revises

**Context Mutation**: Substrate change resulting from approved work (tracked in audit trail)

**Unified Governance**: Single approval process handling both work quality and substrate integrity

**Substrate**: Layer 1 entities (blocks, documents, insights, timeline) — the knowledge base

**Provenance**: Complete lineage from task → work session → reasoning → artifacts → substrate

### Relationships

```
Work Session (1) → Work Artifacts (N)
Work Session (1) → Checkpoints (N)
Work Session (1) → Iterations (N)
Work Session (1) → Context Mutations (N)

Work Artifact → Block (substrate application)
Work Artifact → Document (substrate application)
Work Artifact → External File (no substrate impact)

Work Session → Agent SDK Session (cross-system tracing)
```
